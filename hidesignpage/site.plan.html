        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The home page wireframe is designed to make a strong first impression. At the top, a clear header contains the company logo and navigation links. Below this, a large hero image will feature one of the stunning landscape photos, with the "Welcome to Hi Design..." text overlaid as a powerful introductory statement. The page will then be divided into clear sections: a brief "About Us" to build trust, a grid showcasing the main services to guide users, and another grid for portfolio highlights to visually prove your expertise. A clear call-to-action button will be present to encourage quote requests. The footer will contain contact details and navigation links for easy access from anywhere on the page
      </p>
      <img src="images/Screenshot_21-6-2025_13918_127.0.0.1.jpeg" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>         
        The Services page wireframe focuses on clarity and detail. It will start with the same consistent header. The main content area is organized into a series of sections, one for each service you offer (e.g., Landscape Design, Hardscaping, Maintenance). Each section will have a title, a descriptive paragraph, and a relevant image next to it. This side-by-side layout makes the information easy to digest. This structure allows you to go into detail for each service, helping clients understand the full scope of what Hi Design offers. The page ends with a prominent call-to-action, prompting the user to get in touch for a consultation.
      </p>

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>         
        The Contact Us page is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. The wireframe shows the header at the top for consistency. The page is split into two main columns. On the left, essential contact information like phone number, email, and business hours will be clearly listed. On the right, a simple contact form will allow users to easily send a message or request a quote. The form will include fields for their name, email, phone, and a message. Including an image at the bottom, as you've planned, will keep the page visually engaging and consistent with the rest of the site's branding.
